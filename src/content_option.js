    "I love making stuff and solving problems ever since I was a kid, from Lego to Minecraft to Arduino to now, coding! I was working on the $100 computer project to help underprivileged kids study online during the covid time. I went to the families' houses and personally handed the computers to the kids, and seeing the kids' happy faces still makes me sleep better at night and want to do more stuff like this.That's also when I realized the number of problems I can solve is directly proportional to the amount of knowledge I have. Big or small, I can make a change in the world using technology and it makes me feel good. I decided to let this be my life goal, solve real problems, invent cool stuff, and help people. Let's geek! Currently looking for new grad position in Full-Stack Engineer/Front-end Engineer/Back-end Engineer.",
